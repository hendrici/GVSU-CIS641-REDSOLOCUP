# Meeting #2

Team name: REDSOLOCUP

Members present: Isaiah Hendrick

Date: 10/11/2024

Time: 8:00 pm

Discussion points: 

* What will circuit between microcontroller and bluetooth module look like
* Structure of code base, what files/libraries will be needed 
* Bluetooth module actually uses UART to communicate with microcontroller, may be easier than initially thought

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Get project code template started within Code Composer Studio (ISAIAH)
* Finally received hardware but did not have time to setup circuit; need to get circuit setup, should be relatively simple (ISAIAH)
* Attempt to get bluetooth messages to transmit (ISAIAH)
