# Meeting #4

Team name: REDSOLOCUP

Members present: Isaiah Hendrick

Date: 11/01/2024

Time: 8:30 pm

Discussion points: 

* Need to redefine project requirements, probably will not have time to simulate VT100 style terminal
* Fell behind on progress with the project, need to get back on track
* Began work on bluetooth messaging, seems to be off to a good start, unable to send/receive message yet though

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Continue working on bluetooth messaging (ISAIAH)
* Need to determine within next two weeks if I will be making an enclosure and PCB for project or not, currently not the highest priority (ISAIAH)
