Discussion points: 

* Finally able to send bluetooth message
* Decided that I will be making a PCB, will not need an enclosure however
* Brainstorm ways to condense code and make it cleaner

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Combine bluetooth and terminal messaging, should be able to enter message on terminal and have it appear on other terminal
* Tidy up code, currently very messy from trying to get bluetooth to work
* Start working on PCB design, should be relatively simple construction
