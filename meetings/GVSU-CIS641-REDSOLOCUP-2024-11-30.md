# Meeting #5

Team name: REDSOLOCUP

Members present: Isaiah Hendrick

Date: 11/30/2024

Time: 6:30 pm

Discussion points: 

* Managed to fix bluetooth problem, ended up being something with configuration and problem pairing correctly
* Talking back and forth between terminals is kinda messy, I think the only way to improve is by adding an OS, which is beyond the scope of this project
* Problem where newline character remains in buffer after clearing, messing up read function

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Look into some basic ANSI escape codes to use for formatting/color (ISAIAH)
* See if there are any basic solutions for talking back and forth problem (ISAIAH) 
* Add trim function to make sure newline character is removed from buffer at start of while loop (ISAIAH)
