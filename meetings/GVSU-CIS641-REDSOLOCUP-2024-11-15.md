# Meeting #5

Team name: REDSOLOCUP

Members present: Isaiah Hendrick

Date: 11/15/2024

Time: 7:00 - 7:30 pm

Discussion points: 

* Bluetooth no longer working? Don't know what happened
* Probably will not have enough time to do PCB like initially wanted, not really needed however, due to circuit connecting HC-05 and MSP432 being direct connection
* UART instance configuration for bluetooth module might need some editing

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Make sure bluetooth works reliably (ISAIAH)
* Work on sending messages back and forth between serial terminal and bluetooth module through separate UART instances (ISAIAH)
* Editing of "read" functions (ISAIAH)
